## Odoo Learning Repository

This repository only contains the directory where the modules or the custom code have been built. 

### Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Install and set up the environment, including configuring the PostgreSQL database to work with Odoo.

- Understand the architecture of Odoo, including its modular structure and framework.

- Learn how to use models, views, menus, security, and APIs in Odoo.

- Develop custom modules.

### Develop custom modules:

Learn and apply core Odoo components, such as:

- Models (data representation and business logic)

- Views (user interface design)

- Menus (navigation structure)

- Security (access control and user roles)

- APIs (external integrations and internal communication)
